# Great Snakes
For this challenge we are provided with the following script

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
# import this

if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    print("You are running Python 2, which is no longer supported. Please update to Python 3.")

ords = [81, 64, 75, 66, 70, 93, 73, 72, 1, 92, 109, 2, 84, 109, 66, 75, 70, 90, 2, 92, 79]

print("Here is your flag:")
print("".join(chr(o ^ 0x32) for o in ords))
```
When executed, it gives us the flag to solve the challenge..

``` shell
âžœ  great_snakes git:(main) python3 great_snakes_35381fca29d68d8f3f25c9fa0a9026fb.py
Here is your flag:
crypto{z3n_0f_pyth0n}
```
## Explanation

We can see that the script imports the `sys` library, this to detect if the Python version is greater than 2 in this line of code.

``` python
if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    print("You are running Python 2, which is no longer supported. Please update to Python 3.")
```

Then, we have an array called `ords` that has 21 numbers.

``` python
ords = [81, 64, 75, 66, 70, 93, 73, 72, 1, 92, 109, 2, 84, 109, 66, 75, 70, 90, 2, 92, 79]
```

The numbers in this array are letters in their decimal representation, we can look at the ASCII tables to check this.

At the end of the script, using the chr() function returns a string containing the character associated with the specified character code. and applies an XOR function `^` with `0x32`.

``` shell
>>> chr(81 ^ 0x32)
'c'
>>>
```
